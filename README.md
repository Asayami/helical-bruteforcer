# Helical Bruteforcer
multithread dictionary / brute force attack template using wgen password generator
# Introduction
Firstly, you can generate a wordlist for dictionary attacks using this site: [WGen](https://app.wgen.io/). You can customize any patterns you want or just use my config in this repo. You also can download an offline version of WGen and customize its source code too!
After that, you can modify the intruder.py to respond to your target. I already wrote a simple multi-thread brute force tool so you can customize it to what you need.
